                Kurn enters a small clearing. <br>
                The orb of light reveals an eerie seen. <br>
                Several scarecrow like figures hang <br>
                from the branches, ropes around their <br>
                necks, heads tilted, faces hidden in <br>
                the darkness of their hoods.

                As Kurn watches, crows fly into the <br>
                clearing, one for each of the scarecrows <br>
                They place glowing gems within the darkened <br>
                cowls of the scarecrows.

                The scarecrows jerk to life. They reach up <br>
                to the ropes they hang from and quickly <br>
                scramble up into the darkness of the <br>
                overhanging branches.
